# Scavenger Hunt App

## Overview

The **Scavenger Hunt App** is an iOS application developed in **SwiftUI** using the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture. The app allows users to participate in a virtual scavenger hunt by locating hidden items, viewing clues, marking items as found, tracking their progress, and earning rewards based on the number of completed items.

This project was created as part of an iOS development assignment to demonstrate SwiftUI concepts including NavigationStack, Lists, state management, MVVM, Photo Picker integration, and reusable views.
